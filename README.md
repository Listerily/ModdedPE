# ModdedBE
A professional but **FREE** NMod Launcher for Minecraft Bedrock Editions (Android ONLY).  
**ModdedBE is under development temporarily.**

This ModdedBE project is a completely new NMod launcher compared to the last one "ModdedPE".It is designed to support multi-versions of Minecraft, and there're possibilities for it to become a cross-platform Minecraft Launcher.
**ATTENTION:** Former NMods for ModdedPE could not be loaded with ModdedBE.

## Run the code
 Download Android Studio, android sdk and android ndk.

 **ATTENTION:** Please install Mincraft first.Running on physical devices is recommended, as there are quite a lot opengl problems on android virtual devices on which you cannot open Minecraft even though you don't use ModdedBE.
